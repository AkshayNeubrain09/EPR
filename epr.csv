After having engaged with regulators, plastics industry, start-ups , packaging companies, recyclers, NGO's & other stakeholders & observing the narrative on this emotional subject of , I have penned a few thoughts on the state of regulations in PWM in India. Our regulators are going overboard and being influenced with foreign consultants who have no idea of the situation on the ground and how to integrate India's inherent strengths and leverage them into the regulations. The regulatory bodies in our country would be well advised to be ""AtmaNirbhar"" in their thinking as well.

- Introduction of extended producer responsibility (EPR) for textile waste
- Modulated fees under the EPR scheme for harder to recycle and non-recyclable textile products
- Eco-design standards for products for durability and recyclability
- Eco-labelling to inform consumers on recyclability, responsible production, improved materials, etc. of the product
- Separate collection of textile waste
- Ban on landfill and incineration of textile waste
- Tax rebate on textile products having more than minimum recycled content
- Financial support for textile production and management infrastructure
- National communication campaigns for behavioural change of customers

has suggested that implementation of a combination of the above measures will enable successful management and halve the quantity of residual textile waste in UK by 2030-35. However, it appears that these measures will be implemented much farther in the future given UK's current focus on EPR for plastic packaging.",

By adopting EPR policies and exploring AFR options, businesses can reduce waste and increase sustainability.
Using plastic waste as an Alternative Fuel Resource (AFR) in cement coprocessing is a promising solution for reducing plastic waste and increasing sustainability. When plastic waste is used as AFR, it is burned at high temperatures along with other fuels like coal, oil, or natural gas to generate heat in the cement manufacturing process. This helps to reduce the use of fossil fuels and can also lower carbon emissions.
At the same time, cement companies can also benefit from Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) policies. EPR policies require producers to take responsibility for their products' entire lifecycle, including disposal and recycling. By adopting EPR policies, cement companies can reduce the environmental impact of their products and create a more sustainable supply chain.
Overall, using plastic waste as AFR in cement coprocessing and adopting EPR policies are complementary strategies that can help to reduce waste, increase sustainability, and create new business opportunities for cement companies.

Recently, DoEF&CC hosted a discussion with the Municipal Commissioner of Lucknow, as well as senior officials from UPPCB, , , , and others, to develop an EPR-supported model for ensuring end-of-life disposal of RDF generated from the City's legacy waste and daily waste. Rollz India has developed some excellent local waste to energy (Steam) generation interventions aimed at supplying clean and sustainable steam to industry.

This model has proven to be very successful in Ghaziabad because it consumes RDF from local decentralised MRFs without incurring significant transportation costs. DoEF&CC, Municipal Corporation of Prayagraj, and developed and implemented an integrated model for end-of-life disposal of Prayagraj RDF in Rohtas. The possibility of developing a similar model for Lucknow has also been investigated, and the participation of Ultra Tech Cement is very encouraging.

Under the leadership of a very young and dynamic officer, Mr Inderjit Singh, Municipal Commissioner with iron will, Lucknow City is constantly undergoing transformation. It brings me great joy and satisfaction to contribute to this noble cause.

We sincerely believe that should come forward and adopt a specific geography or city in order to focus their efforts on meeting their EPR obligations. This will also assist them in showcasing their efforts and increasing their visibility in the ecosystem.

We hereby appeal to the PIBOs to come forward and work together to achieve this noble goal of transforming Lucknow into a quality-of-life city.

This means entities that generate and use plastic packaging have a responsibility to ensure end of life management of their plastic waste (equivalent to the plastic packaging that they have generated/used).
 
Currently, India is one of the very few countries in where EPR for plastic packaging is law and is also being actively implemented. This is commendable and many lessons from India can be applied across other South East Asian countries that have similar socio-economic conditions, informal waste sector and infrastructure.
 
One of the biggest positives to have come out of EPR in India is the collection and creation of a market for plastic waste (such as multi-layered plastics, thin flexibles etc.) These categories of plastic were historically dumped and never recovered by the informal waste sector because it had no monetary value. EPR has now infused funds from the PIBOs towards its collection and channelisation towards processing. There is still a long way to go for creation of sustainable and ethical plastic waste recovery systems in India but EPR is definitely a start.",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D22AQHKwgGpL48dYw/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1663651361171?e=1683158400&v=beta&t=N3ffHyyUDH1aIiiAlWLjACgaMR4oBcbbZ5azc2Zo0po

A solution to the problem we can't bear,
A world that's filled with waste, so much to share,
We must act fast before it's beyond repair.

It's not just about the sea, the shore or sand,
It's about the life that's there, the future land,
We must protect it, with a helping hand,
And plastic credits is where we must stand.

One credit per plastic bag, that's the deal,
Reducing waste and saving our next meal,
An investment in the world, so we can heal,
And give the future a chance to reveal.

So let's embrace this new economy,
Where waste is reduced and our planet is free,
Let's be the change we want to see,
And make plastic credits a reality.

For a cleaner world, for the animals too,
For the air we breathe, the water that's blue,
For the generations that are yet to come through,
Let's make plastic credits our chosen view.

Ambedkar School of Economics University,"July and August 2022 will go down as a couple of the most remarkable months of my life. I was excited at the opportunity to intern at the organization which pioneered electronic trading in India. Still, I was unaware of the sheer scale and magnitude at which NSE ran.

What followed was two months of learning and working with incredible folks at the Economic and Policy Research (EPR) team. Led by Sir and Ma'am, the team introduced me to several concepts which they researched and involved us in some projects which would expand our view of the market and the intricacies behind them as well. I deeply appreciate the mentorship and guidance from the rest of the team - ma'am, sir, (sir), and (ma'am) - all of whom were always ready to solve our queries, project-related or not.

Meeting with eminent Professors like and and learning from them via the conferences organized by the EPR team introduced me to topics I hadn't even heard about before, much less talked about them. Within a matter of two months, I learned about dark pools, high-frequency trading, market microstructure, crypto exchanges, and ESG - all of which I wish to study more and get deeper into the increasingly complex world of capital markets.

The cherry on top was interning with , a friend of over 4 years and one of the best guys to hang out and joke with while working on our project together, and meeting several other interns from different institutes, all of whom made the experience that much more wholesome and enjoyable. , , , , , , and - you all are amazing and I hope we can meet up someday to reminisce about our internship and maybe even collaborate in the future.

I would finally like to acknowledge my Professors at BASE University, Prof , and Prof , both of whom brought this massive opportunity to Naman and me.

By the end of the two months, I didn't want to leave (a sentiment echoed by all the other interns as well :')). NSE - you astounded me, exhilarated me, and I can't wait to be here again.

Why is this a hot topic for the packaging industry in helping to achieve the circular economy?

1. A mono-material is a product which is only composed of a single type of material.

2. As the market is increasingly seeking to achieve the circular economy by recycling plastic packaging at maximum efficiency, packaging manufacturers are looking for substitute materials, and this is where mono-material packaging comes in.

3. The key characteristic of mono-material packaging is the use of films that are made entirely out of a single material, such as all PE or all PP in each layer.

Recent Mono material packaging concept:

1. Machine direction oriented polyethylene (MDO-PE ) company is playing important role in producing packaging material which can be packed by the mono material.

2. With MDO-PE stand up pouch we can overcome recycling issue with mixed material laminates like PET PE.

3. V- shapes unveils mono-polymer substrate for recyclable high- barrier applications.

4. Replacing Paper or PET with OPP films.

5. Replacing Aluminium Foil or vacuum coated PET with high barrier OPP films.

6. Recyclable high-performance Polyfoil mono-material barrier tube

7. Heat resistance biaxially oriented polypropylene (HRBOPP)

8. has decided that their oral care brands Pepsodent, close-up is planning to change their tooth pastes to recyclable tubes. As earlier these tooth pastes are made by aluminium and plastic laminates and they are trying to replace it with HDPE.",

How are companies claiming plastic neutrality?

First, what is the definition of plastic neutral? Considering that it is similar to what Carbon Neutrality means, how can recycling sales-equivalent amount of post consumer use plastic waste amount to neutrality? Doesn't the plastic re-enter the environment post recycling, albeit as a different product? Also, a decent percentage of the collected plastic waste (most of the MLP waste) is burnt off in cement kilns as part of co-processing which is far from being environment friendly. For the part that is recycled, recycling in itself is not very eco-friendly with its own set of emissions in the process. What about the internal plastic waste generated in organizations from their manufacturing sites? Is anyone revealing the plastic waste generated because of changes in sales forecasts? While Carbon neutrality means that an organization offsets all carbon emissions and it does have a positive impact on the environment, plastic neutrality is definitely not the same! It has its own set of environmental issues and it does not even mean that equivalent amount of plastic is completely removed from the environment. To call a spade a spade, It only means that equivalent amount of plastic waste is rebranded!

As part of the Plastic Waste Management Rules, collecting and recycling post consumer use plastic is a basic ask from Brand Owners, it is funny to see organizations gloat about the same under this new term of plastic neutrality.

I hope that strict guidelines on using such terms are brought in by authorities, otherwise it will just be an unchecked marketing gimmick.

I sincerely tip my hat to the brands that are talking of the best way to tackle the problem of waste: reduction at source.

Thanks to ‚ÄúThe Policy Times‚Äù for providing a platform where all the stakeholders (tyre manufactures, recyclers, policymakers, regulators and upcoming entrepreneurs) come together and discussed all the aspects of circular economy and in specific the upcoming EPR Regulation in Tyres.
During my talk I emphasized on the following:
(a)   Producers should not limit their role only up to purchase of EPR Certificates from Registered Recyclers to meet their liability and filing of quarterly return. In fact, they must take the responsibility to ensure that the fund generated from EPR must be invested in sustainable technology upgradation of recycling process making it more beneficial to environment.
(b)  We need to establish a more transparent and inclusive governance system to ensure sustainable development of waste tyres recycling technologies ‚Äì to achieve full recovery at highest possible value and minimum material functionality loss in an environmentally beneficial manner.
(c)   Regulatory support ‚Äì in laying down specifications for quality and safety of secondary raw materials
(d)  Need to develop internal market for secondary raw material
(e)   Technological feasibility of direct material substitution (closed loops)
And to achieve all these we need to initiate unprecedented collaboration among tyre manufacturer, recyclers and regulators.",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5622AQFYPcW37EmX1A/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1658390791545?e=1683158400&v=beta&t=Re05qUTQaS9l-iRl-pxel45zAi2VN8v87vb3zvr72SQ

Electronic waste (E-waste) and plastic waste are two of the biggest environmental challenges facing India today. The government has taken steps to address these issues through Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) policies, which require manufacturers and importers of electronic and plastic products to take responsibility for the environmental impact of their products throughout their lifecycle.

However, it has been observed that many people are cheating in E-waste and Plastic waste EPR by engaging in malpractices such as creating fake documents without actually collecting and recycling the waste. This not only undermines the EPR policies but also contributes to the growing environmental crisis.

The so-called great PROs (Producer Responsibility Organizations) that are tasked with implementing EPR policies are also reportedly engaging in similar malpractices. This is alarming because these organizations play a key role in ensuring that manufacturers comply with EPR policies and that the waste is collected and recycled properly.

To address this issue, it is essential to raise awareness and hold all stakeholders accountable. The government must take strict action against those who engage in malpractices and ensure that the EPR policies are implemented effectively. The public must also be educated about the importance of proper waste management and recycling.

This is a significant development for the sector and one of the most virtuous examples in the world. Now Retreaders will be allowed to issue Retreading Certificates through which the  for a tyre producer can get an advantage on its waste tyres responsibility.

A growing number of Indian organisations aim to achieve a carbon-neutral supply chain, and a high-quality retreading system, like Marangoni‚Äôs RINGTREAD, can play a big role in this.

With this policy initiative, India has shown leadership in recognising retreading and its role in a  sector. India, with its network of Franchisees, aims to be an integral part of this journey.

A visit to Hingoniya Goshala near Jaipur presented two paradoxes to me: 1. An extremely good Bio-CNG plant which uses Cow dung as feed from the 14500 cattle being rehabilitated in the Goshala. This Bio CNG supplies fuel to several industries and Akshayapatra midday meal kitchens which feed many students 2. These are the same cattle (95% of them) who have ended up in this Goshala due to the indiscriminate garbage disposal by humans. Yes, these cattle end up eating plastics from mixed, unsegregated waste leading to 'Rumen impaction' and ‚Äú Non penetrating Foreign Body Syndrome‚Äù. Over a period of time, these plastic materials make large tight balls inside the rumen leading to anorexia, decreased milk production and progressive loss of body mass.

The sight of these animals with surgical scars is heart wrenching. In India all life including insects, birds and all animals have a sanctity of its own and violence against these creatures is condemned in many of our scriptures (Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism). According to the caretakers of Hingoniya, one out of 10 cattle which are brought to these rehabilitation centre dies due to the plastic waste. Rest of them barely survive the surgeries, which remove almost 50-70 kgs of plastics, nails, cables etc, from their stomachs. An estimated five million cows roam India's cities, with many gorging on the vast amounts of plastic litter on the streets. Every Indian is thus responsible for atleast one Gohathya in our lifetime.",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5622AQHMS-uEItZ3fQ/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1662998786618?e=1683158400&v=beta&t=A4VaKzHSSfz4zNkqp8qo-wtE4IPkKPHS1ZWLh6k12Tk

New rules will replace the Batteries (Management and Handling) Rules, 2001.

The rules cover all types of batteries, viz. Electric Vehicle (EV) batteries, portable batteries, automotive batteries, and industrial batteries. This is big news as our country is gearing up for the production of EVs and none of the existing laws was covering the management of Lithium Iron battery waste.

The rules function based on the concept of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) where the producers (including importers) of batteries are responsible for the collection and recycling/refurbishment of waste batteries and the use of recovered materials from wastes into new batteries.

EPR mandates that all waste batteries to be collected and sent for recycling/refurbishment, and its prohibits disposal in landfills and incineration. To meet the EPR obligations, producers may engage themselves or authorise any other entity for collection, recycling or refurbishment of waste batteries.

On the principle of Polluter Pays Principle, environmental compensation will be imposed for non-fulfilment of Extended Producer Responsibility targets, responsibilities and obligations set out in the rules.

We have recently completed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) with EHS Compliance including Evaluating Electric Vehicle (EV) Battery Charging Station Specifications based on National & International Codes & Standards. Our EV Experts have worked with various leading players in the EV segment.

However, the portal (Question 8 C in Part C) provides only a drop-down menu from which the producers have to choose their brand owners. There is no option to type the name of the Brand Owner.
This means the producer will have to wait till all of his brand owners have taken the registration through the new portal. This is a potential deadlock.

By virtue of the latest couple of organizations I worked for, I got the chance to work on successful registrations of entities across the value chain of plastic packaging - as a brand owner, a producer as well as a processor under the new Platic Waste Management Rules of February 2022.

Credit where it is due, I must say that the and have done a fantastic job in designing and setting up the registration process and having gone through the value chain, from producer to processor, the thought , understanding and logical sense maintained is evident and worth appreciating. Ofcourse, there are indeed some areas of improvement but by and large , it is a job well done.

The speed of approval/responses too has been extremely quick and if the organization has truly understood the essence of the rules, there is no reason why the applications would be unsuccessful.
On the contrary, I feel that the corporates have been left underprepared and illequipped to meet the demands of the laws - in terms of data management as well as understanding. All the rejected registrations indicate this.

The key challenge, as is always the case in India, will be the implementation. None the less, it is an exciting time to be working in this field and I hope that the 2030 vision becomes a reality in true spirit!",

And the moment came, üìàgradually discussion start to build.
All experts was adding serious topics in the conversations.
And suddenly ü•¥ ""mess me"" Observe that everybody was adding familiar topics that I had thought before coming in the conference hall. And I realised that each one of the participants was underlining the same points as of mine.
After a while, I also started adding values to the discussion and audience start to recognised and appreciate them.

That time I realised that, üòéexperts also think in the same fashion as We ""normal people"" thinks.
The only difference is that, they express their Thoughts through decorative words which oblige listeners to sitting and think it over.

That very day , I learnt a new style of Doing meaningful conversations among experts and

Then it reaches streams, which turn into rivers, which go into the ocean with all this trash. It is also from rivers in these hills that many urban places get their drinking water supply.... what are we drinking?

As per SWM Rules 2016, collection of waste is a mandate of local government bodies. As per the rule with reference to Extended Producer's Responsibility (EPR), producers and brands are responsible for all waste generated by them.

Is ER=EPR Conjecture proposed by Leonard Susskind and Juan Maldacena in 2013, a solution for AMPS firewall paradox ?

ER (Einstein-Rosen) paper is on the geometry of the black holes and EPR (Einstein-Podoslky-Rosen) is a paper on quantum entanglement published in the same year 1935.

ER=EPR solves the AMPS firewall paradox by claiming that two maximally entangled black holes are connected through a warmhole.

The time evolution of the warmhole is explained using the penrose diagram of kruskal extension of schwarzschild black hole, which keeps growing till infinite space and time even after the black hole has attained its thermal equilibrium.

The authors have supported this idea by the concept of maximum complexity of a system, i.e. exponential time is taken by a quantum system to attain it‚Äôs maximum complexity, because of which warmhole is able to grow and evolve.

This conjecture also claims that any entangled particles, irrespective of their properties are connected through a planck scale warmhole.",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D22AQFdjBO1bAzqEQ/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1671770806777?e=1683158400&v=beta&t=6yNE5V5xhLgqU1A5fYKG41oaXfExW1zB7JhC6x5JOGM

Thanks Michaela Wachtel and Ton Knipscheer for that effort.
Well this interview was originally conducted few months ago.

Reproducing this with some pictures randomly picked right from the time of 80s
Thanks for your valuable time to listen to this.

The questions were

1. We always start our episodes with a short introduction. Can you tell us something about yourself and your career so far? From what we know, you started out in a paper mill.
2. As stated in the introduction, you have more than one function and all on senior level. How do you combine all these roles and how do you manage your time?
3. So the field of packaging for pharmaceuticals is your current area of work. Can you elaborate on the specifics when it comes to packaging in this particular field?
4. During your speeches at conferences, you have often said something very interesting: ""Packaging will be your second physician"". Please tell us what you mean by that.
5. Could you tell us a bit more about your role as Global Ambassador for the WPO?
6. How does the Indian packaging market look in general? What is the mindset of
people when it comes to plastic and packaging in general?
7. What about recycling in India? Is there a recycling system or how is packaging
waste handled?
8. In the preliminary conversation, you mentioned that India is self-sufficient. That is
an amazing achievement for a country with such a large population. Can you
elaborate on that?
9. To conclude this episode, is there anything you would like to add?",

Ltd. are taking responsibility of ethical recycling of all types of Plastic waste on behalf of Plastic Producers, Importers, Brandowners and Manufacturers in accordance with Extended Producers Responsibility (EPR) obligations. Previously, a producer‚Äôs responsibility was limited to production and sales; it was deemed enough that the producer made sure that in the manufacturing process it did not harm the health and safety of its workers or residents of its environs and that its sold products were safe and did not pose risks to the public. The producer responsibility has then been ‚Äòextended‚Äô (hence the name) to later stages of a product‚Äôs life-cycle: disposal, recycling, and reuse. So, Speaking of all stakeholders, consumers still have the responsibility to properly recycle after they are finished consuming the products. Imagine if all consumers didn‚Äôt bother recycling their drink bottles and just chucked them into general trash to be landfilled; it would render all the efforts by companies to recycle pointless. Consumers have the responsibility to properly dispose of these products while producers and recycling processing companies have the responsibility to collect and reuse as well as many others in the chain. The below picture attached depicts the negligence and aloof nature of consumers towards the product that has been used. This attitude needs to be changed because it's not only the responsibility of PIBO's and Plastic waste processors to manage waste efficiently but its the responsibility of Consumers also to properly dispose the plastic waste at their end so that the further action on plastic waste management could be taken more efficiently. #",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D22AQGeNdXJnvEbBA/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1658825195477?e=1683158400&v=beta&t=xU3PLrqHAiwA4OAbPsX0Dh3ycjy8QAwzrpH-TpQQRAI

1.0 All topics considered under ESG are inherently beneficial for the society - think about health benefits of reducing , economical benefits of promoting and .

2.0 interest on these topics are intensifying - think about , unification and regulations

Middlemen Have been a staple in many business in India and abroad. There was a time when you could not do without them, but that time is long gone, yet here in India we allow them to function as individuals/companies or NGO‚Äôs insuring that true financial value is not delivered to people or companies actually doing the work.

Brands trying to implement EPR in india have the opportunity to save massive amounts of money while making real environmental & social impact by dealing directly companies that collect, segregate & aggregate plastic waste & by doing away with NGO‚Äôs and others acting as traders keeping majority of the revenues for them selves.

Middle men and organisations acting like middle men have been successfully profiteering at the cost of consumers/companies and the under privileged while providing little accountability in the process.

RACE stands for reduction, awareness, circular solutions, and mass engagement. It was organized by Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH and UP Government.
 
With a ban on single-use plastic, there is a pressing need for entrepreneurs to come up with innovative ideas. The conclave provided budding opportunity to exhibit their innovative products such as cutlery made up of husk, bamboo pulp, bagasse, maize starch, etc. These are readily being picked up by the major restaurant chains. Some efforts to reduce plastic use is addressed by providing refill solutions to consumers as designated malls where they can get their bottle for liquid products (detergent, etc.) filled at discounted price. One startup has started delivering the same service at doorsteps by tying up with popular consumer brands. Consumer behavior change was seen as a major roadblock in its mass adoption.
 
Representatives from industries such as FMCG (Hindustan Unilever), leading cement companies and others shared about their efforts and challenges in managing plastic waste. The major challenge identified was the segregation of different categories of plastic waste for recycling. The companies shared their strategies to contribute to the circular economy of plastic, one of these shared by Hindustan Lever being adding value to plastic used in packaging such that the plastic pickers find the waste worthy for recycling. They also shared their Extended Producer Responsibility () commitments and how they are prepared to go beyond compliance to ensure net zero leakage of plastic they use for packaging to the environment.

Also, startups dealing with plastic waste segregation identified multilayer plastic packaging as a huge threat to the environment as it is difficult to viably segregate the plastic with the accessible technology.

But, as a development professional, one can always look for opportunities in the challenge posed by the plastic. Few NGOs/ institutions are actively engaged in supporting such initiatives and taking it to the masses through material recycling facilities (MRFs) in cities and villages, generating livelihoods for the poor. Such facilities require trained human resources who can benefit themselves and Mother Nature. Many other facets for livelihoods can be explored in the area. Your suggestions are welcome.",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D22AQFPn6Rk4LCykw/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1657049745615?e=1683158400&v=beta&t=4HpP5Oy0z84h7CR_YMqrfmXDzjYQYrwhHN79rsCJKgw

What better place to build a place of worship than this? However, what's happening to this place right now is far from sacred.

This is the view from the famous Mukteshwar Mahadev temple in , . As per locals from the area, shops and eateries started springing up within the last decade. Tourism is considered an important source of revenue for many Himalayan regions, encouraged by both the private sector and the government.

Who will encourage waste management? Will tourists still come here if the place keeps on becoming more dirty? Do we simply blame the locals? What are the shopkeepers supposed to do when there is no collection service for the waste generated at this site?

Due to lack of options, all the waste generated by shops and two resorts in the area is dumped behind the shops, in the forest, right next to a trail. Once the pit is full, and often even before that, the waste is set on fire.

Have you read the new rules (draft) for plastics, e-waste, and batteries. Uploading draft rules on batteries that might be implemented in the near future.

My two cents on these rules are:

1. It may wipe out informal recyclers/smelters and the market would be governed by a few large players in the Industry.
2. PROs will be wiped out of the system, they may become WMAs and can act as suppliers to these large recyclers, only if they can compete on the cost(s).
3. The recyclers need to work more in strengthening their procurement channels as well as downstream vendors so as to constantly feed material in their system so as to attain ethical/clean profit(s).
4. Producers will attain easy EPR certificates from Recyclers at their desired/competitve cost(s), and each recycler will be fighting neck to neck to attract producer(s).
5. Demand for a productive and efficient workforce will increase and most of the recycler(s) will fetch talent from PROs.
6. Acquisition cost may reduce as recycler(s) will procure material directly from the source/aggregators.
7. Informal sector may get merged with the formal sector but at a slow pace of course.
8. Government may become stringent in terms of compliances and may penalize heavily if any recycler/refurbisher/producer/brand owner is found unsatisfactory.

Above is my understanding, would love to interact and learn more from each one of you. Do comment.

Whatever it unfolds, the sector is getting interesting with great opportunities for both employees as well as employers!",

Can Extended Producer's Responsibility (EPR) as well as Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) be used by companies in their Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to show that they have reduced the impacts?
Also it would be great if you could specifically speak whether it impacts the Organisational LCA (O-LCA) or Product LCA. A brief discussion here could clear this doubt as many companies are focusing on reducing their environmental impacts and achieving milestones such as Net Zero.",

.
A recently concluded international fair in our town has left us with humongous piles of waste packaging plastic brought in by the merchants who set up their stalls in the city ground. Of course, the municipality will clean it up but taking it all to the landfill site is not a solution; it's just the attitude.
.
It is high time we introduce circular economy concepts in temporary and minor aspects of our life. If merchants/shopkeepers handle the packaging plastic carefully and take it back, it can be reused for packaging and transport. And, the municipality will not be left with taking care of huge muddy plastic piles. Also, let's not forget the environmental benefits.
.
Here is what we need:
- Cost-benefit analysis of reusing the packaging plastic by the same merchants.
- Awareness among these merchants/shopkeepers about the economic benefits of the circular economy.
- Introduction of extended producer responsibility () at the appropriate link of the supply chain
- Others (please suggest)!",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5622AQFI8vu9_YLidg/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1660209863133?e=1683158400&v=beta&t=i3CpbmBHJTVF1YYAfYW5xygEK8E9InkC3avOp3A2apM
